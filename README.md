## How It's Made

* Tech used: HTML, CSS
* Hero section with heading, subtext, and sign-up button
* Info cards grid with image placeholders
* Testimonial/quote section
* Call-to-action (CTA) banner
* Footer with copyright

## Project Structure

* `index.html` → page structure (nav, header, sections, footer)
* `style.css` → styles (colors, spacing, Flexbox layouts)
* *(optional)* `images/` → add real images later if I want

## Getting Started

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## Learning Goals

* Practice clean, semantic HTML (`nav`, `header`, `section`, `footer`)
* Lay out components with Flexbox (navbar, split hero, cards, CTA)
* Organize a small project with separate HTML/CSS files
* Improve spacing, alignment, and basic responsiveness
